# My SolidJS Template

**JS** | [**Prettier ESLint**](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint) | [**UnoCSS**](https://github.com/unocss/unocss)

## Usage

1. Start a new project: `npx degit lihe07/solidjs-template <project-name>`

2. Install dependencies: `npm i` or `pnpm i`

3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

4. Run eslint: `npm run lint`

## Extensions

This template works best with these vscode extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) **[Highly recommended]**
  For displaying eslint errors and warnings

- [Prettier ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint) **[Highly recommended]**
  For formating code with prettier

- [UnoCSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.unocss) **[Recommended]**
  For unocss autocompletion and style retrieval

## Why this template?

Actually, solidjs team do provide [some templates](https://github.com/solidjs/templates) for solidjs projects. However, these templates often failed to keep up with the latest solidjs version and sometimes need more actions to be done. I also failed to install Prettier ESLint in official templates.
This template is designed to keep up with the latest solidjs version and with Prettier ESLint installed.
